# Perspective
*"Share the worth of your moving picture."*

An iOS app that challenges digital communication norms. Perspective reimagines the side effects of our global hyperconnectivity through a new approach to collaborative storytelling. Users capture personal point of views through video clips and invite collaborators to contribute their perspectives based on a common theme, together creating a story, an experience that can be saved or shared once complete. 

(Swift, Parse, AWS S3, Xcode)
